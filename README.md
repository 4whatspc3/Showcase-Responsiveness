# Showcase-Responsiveness
This project focuses on building a responsive homepage, similar to what you might find on a portfolio site. I'll practice advanced HTML &amp; CSS concepts and develop a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). An important aspect is to ensure a visually appealing presentation as well.
